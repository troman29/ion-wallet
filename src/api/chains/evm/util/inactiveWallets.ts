/**
 * @fileoverview Short-lived memory of "this address has nothing on this chain yet".
 *
 * This is separate from `withCacheAsync` because the two verdicts of `getIsWalletActive` expire
 * differently. "Active" is monotonic - an address that has held a balance or received a transfer
 * can never stop having done so - so the truthy-only cache around it needs no expiry. "Inactive"
 * is revocable by the next block, and a verdict kept for the whole process would leave a wallet
 * that receives its first funds mid-session showing an empty feed until restart. Hence the TTL
 * here, and none on the positive half.
 *
 * Keyed by network, chain and lowercased address, because an address can be busy on one chain
 * and untouched on another. Bounded LRU so a wallet holding many chains cannot grow it without limit.
