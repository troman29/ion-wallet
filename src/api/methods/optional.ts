/**
 * Accessors for the optional half of the API, used by the code that stays in a `NO_EXTRA_FEATURES` build
 * but can still reach into it.
 *
 * `process.env` is read inline rather than through `config`, because Webpack substitutes it before
 * dead-code elimination: that leaves each `require` in a statically false branch, so the module and its
 * dependencies drop out of the bundle. Every caller sits behind a condition that is unreachable in such a
 * build, and the throw makes it obvious if one ever is not.
