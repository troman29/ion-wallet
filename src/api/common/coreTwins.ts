// The retired trimmed TON Wallet builds silently mirrored every wallet onto the opposite network: importing a wallet
// created an invisible twin (same key, same contract) on testnet for a mainnet wallet and vice versa. The full builds
// now serving that storage (wallet.ton.org web and the store extension updated to Gram) expose the network switcher
// and per-account logout, where those hidden twins make `signOut` adopt a twin instead of resetting and let a
// "log out" leave the same secret behind.
//
// This is a boot-time idempotent purge, NOT a state migration: the twin population is defined by the build flavor,
// not the state version, so it must not ride a stateVersion bump. The `coreTwinsPurged` marker keeps it decoupled.
//
// Crash-safety: dapps are cleaned BEFORE accounts, so a partial run leaves the twins still detectable in `accounts`
// and the next boot recomputes the same ids and re-cleans both. The purge always keeps the MAINNET member of a twin
// pair — mainnet holds the real funds, and a testnet-parked user upgrading must not see their mainnet record vanish.
// The `removeAccounts` handler re-selects the active account onto a survivor if the removed twin was current, so no
// `currentAccountId` read is needed here.
